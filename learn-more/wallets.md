# ðŸ”“ Wallets

{% hint style="info" %}
There are many different wallets, but we recomment Metamask on Mobile. Please be sure to exercise caution and **NEVER** share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone!

To access the Disco dance floor and other areas of the Metaverseâ„¢, you'll need a web3 wallet. While some describe it as a digital version of your physical wallet that stores items like cash and gift cards, this isn't entirely accurate. In reality, a web3 wallet stores your private key, which is the most crucial thing to keep secure while navigating the decentralized web.

Your private key is sometimes referred to as the seed phrase and serves as a unique identifier to access and manage your assets on the web3 network. It's essential to write down your seed phrase and keep it safe, as losing or forgetting it can result in losing access to your assets. So, remember to store your private key securely to safeguard your digital identity and assets.

### Different wallet flavors[â€‹](https://docs.disco.xyz/learn/what-is-a-wallet#different-wallet-flavors) (chains) <a href="#different-wallet-flavors" id="different-wallet-flavors"></a>

Web3 wallets come in various types, and each blockchain like Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Solana usually requires a different wallet because they use different data formats and keys. Wallets can also come in different forms such as hardware devices, mobile apps, or browser extensions.

For Disco, we support and recommend using Metamask on Chrome, which is the most widely used web3 wallet in the Ethereum ecosystem. Using Metamask will provide the best experience for interacting with Disco, enabling you to enjoy all of its features seamlessly.

### Getting started with Metamask[â€‹](https://docs.disco.xyz/learn/what-is-a-wallet#getting-started-with-metamask) <a href="#getting-started-with-metamask" id="getting-started-with-metamask"></a>

Metamask offers two products: a browser extension and a mobile app. For interacting with Disco during our Beta, we recommend using the [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) browser extension.

To install the Metamask browser extension, go to the Metamask page on the Chrome Web Store and download it into your browser. The extension is compatible with browsers such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Brave](https://brave.com/).

### Storing your private seed phrase <a href="#continuing-your-journey" id="continuing-your-journey"></a>

Once you have installed the Metamask browser extension, you will need to set it up by following the instructions provided. During the setup process, you will need to create a password and generate a Secret Recovery Phrase, which is also known as a Seed Phrase.

The Secret Recovery Phrase is extremely important because it serves as your private key, allowing you to access all the things that your Private Keys control, such as your cryptocurrency or your Disco profile. Therefore, it is crucial to take extreme care of it.

To ensure its safety, write down the Seed Phrase on paper, making sure the words are in the correct order, and store it in a safe and private place. In case of an unforeseen event such as a computer crash, you can use the Secret Recovery Phrase to reinstall Metamask on a new computer and regain access to your assets.
