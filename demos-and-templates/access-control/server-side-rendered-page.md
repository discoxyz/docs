# Server Side Rendered Page

### What

A TurboETH template for building next generation identity applications powered by Disco.

_Built by @hexcowboy + KamesGeraghty_



### How it works:

The template uses Typescript to gate a page by verifying a credential, in Typescript. The app will ping the Disco API to check for a given credential, and if it exists, render the page generated by `app/disconaut/page.tsx`.

More instructions for local setup in the README below!
