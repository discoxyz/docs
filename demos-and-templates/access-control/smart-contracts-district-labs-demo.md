# Smart Contracts: District Labs Demo

### Offchain <-> Onchain Integration

Using Mask's Delegatable framework, we can now gate access to on-chain logic with checking for Verifiable Credentials. Check for a valid credential in order to qualify for a Mint.

[District Labs ](https://districtlabs.com/)built a demo that allows you to mint a limited edition NFT only if you have a Official Disconaut Credential that has been marked public.&#x20;
