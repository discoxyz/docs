You can’t yet take your actions to the bank, but now you can take your data backpack to the [Disco Swag Store](http://swag.disco.xyz).

### What can your reputation unlock?

Starting today, Tuesday, January 17th, 2023, you’ll be able to bring your data backpack and unlock access to Disco Drip Drop V1.

This collection of Disco merch is available only to data backpack owners.

### Product + Credential Requirements in your Backpack:

### How it works:

* Fill up your data backpack with credentials at [app.disco.xyz](https://app.disco.xyz/)
  * [Fill out this form if you still need a data backpack](https://discoxyz.typeform.com/betabackpacks?typeform-source=swag.disco.xyz)
    * You can receive GMs from your friends, and the Official Disconaut Credential when you complete onboarding.
    * You’ll also be able to create some credentials about yourself and your preferences.
* Make sure your credentials are set to publicly viewable. You can do this in your data backpack under the specific credential and **clicking the eye icon**.
  * **This is VERY IMPORTANT!**
  * Need some GMs? Send a few to people you already know or say hello to new friends through the explore page
  * Reach out to your favorite Disconaut and we’d be happy to hook you up ;)
* Visit [https://swag.disco.xyz/](https://swag.disco.xyz/)
* Connect your wallet, see which products you qualify for!
* Add them to your cart and enjoy! Your reputation has you covered.

Don’t want to do the work? Disco Drip Drop V1 is still available for an exorbitant price. **But would you rather use your money or your reputation to buy some groovy swag?**
