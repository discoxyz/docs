# Button Click: GM Faucet Demo

### **What:**&#x20;

The GM Faucet [Demo](https://disco-gm-faucet.vercel.app/)  is a simple Dapp that allows users to connect their wallets and click a button to receive GM Credentials in their backpack. Similar to traditional token faucets, this DApp leverages the Programmatic Issuance endpoint of the Disco API to issue GMs to the connected wallet after the user clicks the button.

### **How it works:**

1. Users connect their wallets to the DApp, enabling it to interact with their accounts securely.
2. Upon clicking the designated button, the DApp communicates with the Disco Data Backpack to issue GM credentials to the connected wallet's address.
3. The GMs are sent as verifiable credentials (VCs) to the user's DID and data backpack.
4. The user can utilize the issued VCs as cryptographic proof of their possession of GM credentials, validating their ownership and use of the credentials within the Disco ecosystem.
