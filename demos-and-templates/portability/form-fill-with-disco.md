### **How It Works** <a href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works"></a>

The demo starts with a user connecting their wallet, and using the Disco API, we retrieve valid Disco Profile + public credentials to complete the ad-libbed form.Note that the credentials **must be public,** toggled by the user to protect privacy.To get started building with the Form Fill demo, you can follow the simple steps outlined in the README file available at the demo's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/discoxyz/disco-formfill](https://github.com/discoxyz/disco-formfill)​

### **Expanding Possibilities** <a href="#expanding-possibilities" id="expanding-possibilities"></a>

The Form Fill demo is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential applications of Disco Data Backpack. If you're interested in exploring more schemas, here is our repo on GitHub: [http://github.com/discoxyz/disco-schemas](http://github.com/discoxyz/disco-schemas). Feel free to suggest one or put in a PR!With this Form Fill demo, we need to tediously enter data manually; instead, we can leverage the power of our Disco Data Backpack to automatically populate forms with the click of a button. By connecting your wallet and utilizing the Disco API, you can jumpstart personalized experiences faster and more accurately.\
