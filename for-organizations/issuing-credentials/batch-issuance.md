# Batch Issuance

### Batch Issuance

**Preparation:**&#x20;

Batch issuance allows you to issue any credential to a group of DIDs, or Ethereum addresses using _one single click_. In this case, you can issue membership credentials to your entire list of members in one click.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that you will need special permissions, an Organization Credential from Disco. Fill out [this](https://discoxyz.typeform.com/orgcred?typeform-source=app.gitbook.com) form to request one.
{% endhint %}

You will need a .csv file of these addresses, or you can manually input them. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13oj4aKz6ENG0OmqiKNRhPgkUP7XyHJrrccS040x2VWI/edit#gid=577048407) is an example of using DIDs, but you can also replace this with ETH addresses.

**Issuance**

Now you have your CSV prepared, we can issue! Start by navigating to "_Schemas"_ on the top navigation bar.

Click on _**Issue Credential**_. Select the schema that you’d like to issue. If you’d like a custom schema to be added, please reach out in the Discord.

Fill out any relevant fields, and Choose your CSV file you'd like to upload.

Once you’ve uploaded your CSV or put in the recipients manually, the DIDs will populate and you can click on **Issue** to fire them off. Congrats!
