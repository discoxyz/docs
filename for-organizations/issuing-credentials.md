# Issuing Credentials

You have two options for issuing credentials: [#manual-issuance](issuing-credentials.md#manual-issuance "mention") and [#batch-issuance](issuing-credentials.md#batch-issuance "mention").

You can do this manually if you know the recipient's DID, Ethereum address, or social media handle using our search functionality.

Alternatively, if you have a list of Ethereum addresses (NFT holders, Typeform, Airtable), you can also _Batch Issue_ to a set list of recipients using one click!



### Manual Issuance

With the visual branding of your membership credentials now customized, you can proceed to manually issue them one-by-one.\
\
To issue a credential with the special branding, simply click "Issue Credential" from your profile and we'll take care of the rest. You have a few schemas to choose from, but we recommend Membership Credential.



### Batch Issuance

**Preparation:** Batch issuance allows you to issue any credential to a group of DIDs, or Ethereum addresses using _one single click_. In this case, you can issue membership credentials to your entire list of members in one click.

You will need a .csv file of these addresses, or you can manually input them. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13oj4aKz6ENG0OmqiKNRhPgkUP7XyHJrrccS040x2VWI/edit#gid=577048407) is an example of using DIDs, but you can also replace this with ETH addresses.

Start by navigating to "_Schemas"_ on the top navigation bar

Click on the "_Issue Batch Credential button_". Select the schema that you’d like to issue. If you’d like a custom schema to be added, please reach out in the Discord.

Fill out the fields below. In the case below, I’ll fill out the required field: Organizational Name.

On the right side, we’ll list out our recipients. You can either choose to paste a few DID’s, or upload a CSV.

Maybe you have a list of members’ Ethereum addresses, you can reuse this! For the CSV you won’t need any column headers, a simple list is fine.&#x20;

Once you’ve uploaded your CSV or put in the recipients, you can proceed to issuance. Once you ensure everything’s good to go, you can fire it off to your favorite people!
