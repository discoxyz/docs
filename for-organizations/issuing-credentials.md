# Issuing Credentials

You have two options for issuing credentials: [#manual-issuance](issuing-credentials.md#manual-issuance "mention") and [#batch-issuance](issuing-credentials.md#batch-issuance "mention").

You can do this manually if you know the recipient's DID, Ethereum address, or social media handle using our search functionality.

Alternatively, if you have a list of Ethereum addresses (NFT holders, Typeform, Airtable), you can also _Batch Issue_ to a set list of recipients using one click!
