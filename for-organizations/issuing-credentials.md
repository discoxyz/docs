# Issuing Credentials

You have two options for issuing credentials: [#manual-issuance](issuing-credentials.md#manual-issuance "mention") and [#batch-issuance](issuing-credentials.md#batch-issuance "mention").

You can do this manually if you know the recipient's DID, Ethereum address, or social media handle using our search functionality.

Alternatively, if you have a list of Ethereum addresses (NFT holders, Typeform, Airtable), you can also _Batch Issue_ to a set list of recipients using one click!



### Manual Issuance

With the visual branding of your membership credentials now customized, you can proceed to manually issue them one-by-one.\
\
To issue a credential with the special branding, simply click "Issue Credential" from your profile and we'll take care of the rest. You have a few schemas to choose from, but we recommend Membership Credential.



### Batch Issuance

**Preparation:**&#x20;

Batch issuance allows you to issue any credential to a group of DIDs, or Ethereum addresses using _one single click_. In this case, you can issue membership credentials to your entire list of members in one click.

Remember that you will need special permissions, an Organization Credential from Disco. Fill out [this](https://discoxyz.typeform.com/orgcred?typeform-source=app.gitbook.com) form to request one.

You will need a .csv file of these addresses, or you can manually input them. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13oj4aKz6ENG0OmqiKNRhPgkUP7XyHJrrccS040x2VWI/edit#gid=577048407) is an example of using DIDs, but you can also replace this with ETH addresses.

**Issuance**

Now you have your CSV prepared, we can issue! Start by navigating to "_Schemas"_ on the top navigation bar.

Click on _**Issue Credential**_. Select the schema that you’d like to issue. If you’d like a custom schema to be added, please reach out in the Discord.

Once you’ve uploaded your CSV or put in the recipients manually, the DIDs will populate and you can click on **Issue** to fire them off. Congrats!
