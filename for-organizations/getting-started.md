# Getting Started

### Setup

To get started, you'll need to create a new data backpack following the instructions for all users.

{% content-ref url="../getting-started/create-a-data-backpack.md" %}
[create-a-data-backpack.md](../getting-started/create-a-data-backpack.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** you may want to create a new wallet separate from your personal one, or use your existing organization's wallet - this is at your own discretion!
{% endhint %}

### **Creating your Organization**

To unlock custom organization features (Batch Issuance, Custom Credentials), you’ll need to request to become an organization with your Disco Profile.

To do this, fill out this [form](https://discoxyz.typeform.com/orgcred).

Then, Disco will issue an Organizational Credential to your DID, which will allow you to access special features _for organizations._

### Creating Custom Credentials

You can customize several parts of the visual branding of any credential sent by your DID.

Navigate to Edit Profile > Branding where you can customize your organization's credentials, including brand and text color, logo url and background image.
