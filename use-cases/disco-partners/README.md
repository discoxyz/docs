# Disco Partners

_Last_ _updated: May 2, 2023_

### Guild

GM! We’re so pleased to announce that we have shipped our first integration with Guild! You can _**NOW**_ extend the power of token-gating your community with verifiable credentials, which are completely free and all off-chain!

You can read more about guild [here](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild/guides/readme).

#### Capabilities[​](https://docs.disco.xyz/Use%20Cases/gating-access-with-guild#capabilities) <a href="#capabilities" id="capabilities"></a>

By integrating Disco and Guild.xyz, you can now easily:

* Using Verifiable Credentials, you can now gate any of the following (see instructions that follow):
  * [A Telegram chat ](gating-a-telegram-chat-with-guild.md)
  * [A Discord Server](gating-a-discord-server-with-guild.md)
  * [A Google Doc](gating-a-google-doc-with-guild.md)
  * [A Github Repo](gating-a-github-repo-with-guild.md)
* Use AND/OR logic to extend on-chain checks to customize roles and access restrictions even further (NFT ownership, DAO Membership, etc).

#### Join our Guild[​](https://docs.disco.xyz/Use%20Cases/gating-access-with-guild#join-our-guild) <a href="#join-our-guild" id="join-our-guild"></a>

Check if you have access to join our very first pilot guild [here](https://guild.xyz/guild-disco-pilot).

If you have an `OfficialDisconautCredential` marked public, you should be able to access a private Google Doc, Github Repo, and get a role in our Discord Server.

Leave us a surprise, don't be shy!

#### Extending This[​](https://docs.disco.xyz/Use%20Cases/gating-access-with-guild#extending-this) <a href="#extending-this" id="extending-this"></a>

Imagine the endless possibilities!

You can use the AND/OR logic to extend requirements such as a credential and:

* Another type of VC.
* Must follow an account on Twitter
* Must have X amount of an ERC-20 Token
* Must hold an NFT.

We’ll also be adding more schemas soon. For additional requests and questions you may have, reach out to us at: [ask@disco.xyz](mailto:ask@disco.xyz).



### District Labs

Using District Labs' new Delegatable framework, we can now gate access to on-chain logic with checking for Verifiable Credentials.

See this demo [here](https://disco.districtlabs.com/) to mint a limited edition NFT if you have an Official Disconaut Credential.
