# Community Management: Guild.xyz Integration

### Community Management Tools: Guild.xyz Integration

GM! We’re so pleased to announce that we have shipped our first integration with Guild! You can NOW extend the power of token-gating your community with verifiable credentials, which are completely free and all off-chain!

You can read more about guild[ here](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild/guides/readme).

**Capabilities**[​](https://docs.disco.xyz/Use%20Cases/gating-access-with-guild#capabilities)

By integrating Disco and Guild.xyz, you can now easily use Verifiable Credentials to gate:

* A Telegram chat
* A Discord Server
* A Google Doc
* A Github Repo
* Use AND/OR logic to extend on-chain checks to customize roles and access restrictions even further (NFT ownership, DAO Membership, etc).

### **Join our Guild**[**​**](https://docs.disco.xyz/Use%20Cases/gating-access-with-guild#join-our-guild)

Check if you have access to join our very first pilot guild[ here](https://guild.xyz/guild-disco-pilot).

If you have an _**OfficialDisconautCredential**_ marked public, you should be able to access a private Google Doc, Github Repo, and get a role in our Discord Server.

Leave us a surprise, don't be shy!

### **Extending This**[**​**](https://docs.disco.xyz/Use%20Cases/gating-access-with-guild#extending-this)

Imagine the endless possibilities!

You can use the AND/OR logic to extend requirements such as a credential and:

* Another type of VC.
* Must follow an account on Twitter
* Must have X amount of an ERC-20 Token
* Must hold an NFT.

We’ll also be adding more schemas soon. For additional requests and questions you may have, reach out to us at: ask@disco.xyz.
