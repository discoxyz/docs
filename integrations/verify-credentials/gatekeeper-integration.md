# Gatekeeper Integration

### Overview

We are thrilled to announce that GateKeeper has integrated Disco's API in a demo.

With this integration, GateKeeper users can now leverage Disco's API for verification of any Disco.xyz credentials. You can now take control of your personal identity data and choose which reflections of your digital persona you want to share with the world or keep private.

What does this integration mean for you? Now, any community or team that wants to control access to content, UI, DAOs, or databases using Disco credentials can do so seamlessly.

### Setup

1. Sign up as a business customer on GateKeeper to generate an enterprise DID.
2. Create a new Role in the GateKeeper business dashboard.
3. Select "API Check" from the "select user checks" dropdown menu.
4. Under API check, click "template" and choose Disco.XYZ. Select the desired credential types issued by Disco.XYZ and create a curated list of credentials you want to use for access control.
5. Save the role, return to your access control dashboard, and select "check" on your newly created role. Copy and paste the generated code snippet from GateKeeper into the UI of the content you want to GateKeep.
