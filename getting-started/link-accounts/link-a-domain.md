To start, type your domain and click on **Next.**

Click on **Sign** button to sign via your MetaMask to link your Discord account to your identifier

To prove that you have custody/control of this domain/DNS, you'll need to add your DID in your TXT record in your DNS provider such as Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains.&#x20;

**You may administrative priviledges in your particular DNS provider to do this.**

In the following example, I am using Google Domains to add a new TXT record (under DNS Settings >> Default Name Spaces) with my DID.&#x20;

Go back to Disco, check the box once you've added the TXT record and click **Verify.** It may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate, so be patient. \

That's it!
