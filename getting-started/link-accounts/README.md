# 🔗 Link Accounts

### Overview

Now that you’ve signed in with your address and created your backpack, it’s time to add some data by linking a social account or domain. This will help contextualize you beyond a did or Ethereum address. We are humans, after all!&#x20;

We currently support four different account types:

* Twitter account
* Discord handle
* Lens handle
* Domain or website\
