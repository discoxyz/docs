To start, type your discord handle along with the tag (**username#1234**) and click on **Next.**

Click on **Sign** button to sign via your MetaMask to link your Discord account to your identifier

To prove that you have custody/control of this Discord account, you need to share a message on our server. To do this:

* Go to Disco's Discord channel here: [https://discord.com/invite/nvxsa6paYv](https://discord.com/invite/nvxsa6paYv)
* From the instructions page, copy and send the following verification message into the channel #verify-yourself.

This message creates a provable link between your identifier and your discord account. The verifier bot will respond with an attestation link, copy that link and paste it in the text box to confirm!

Click on **Confirm** to confirm this linkage.

Thatâ€™s it! You successfully linked you Discord account to your Backpack.

Click on the **View My Data Backpack** button to return to your profile page.
