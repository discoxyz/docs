# ðŸ§‘ðŸš€ Claiming your Official Disconaut Credential

## Customize your Profile

In order for you to claim your first credential, all you'll need to do is customize your profile by adding a profile picture, and a bio.

You'll see a banner at the top, click on _**Edit My Public Profile.**_

**To add a profile picture,** we can copy the image URL of another PFP we're using.&#x20;

To use your Twitter PFP, navigate to your Twitter Profile. Click on the Profile picture. Right Click, and _copy image address,_ and copy that into the image URL field.
