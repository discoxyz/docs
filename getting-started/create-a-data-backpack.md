# ðŸŽ’ Create a Data Backpack

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You will need an Ethereum compatible wallet! We currently support any Browser Wallet, Rainbow, WalletConnect, and Zerion.

For more information on setting up a wallet, please visit [MetaMask Learn](https://learn.metamask.io/).
{% endhint %}

### Setup

First, head to [https://app.disco.xyz/](https://app.disco.xyz/) on your browser.

Click on _**Connect your Wallet**_**,** and select the wallet you'll be using. If you're using **Metamask**, select Browser Wallet.

Once you connect your wallet, you'll see a pop-up modal to create your Data Backpack.

Click the right arrows to proceed, and you'll be prompted to create a [DID](../learn-more/faqs.md). Click on **Create my DID, then Create new Account** in the following modal.

&#x20;**Click Continue**, to allow Disco access to read and store data from [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/).&#x20;

### **Signing messages to link your Ethereum address**&#x20;

You will now be asked to provide **two signatures** from your wallet.

The first time will connect you to our Disco website, and the second signature will be to create your "did:identifier" for use on the Disco credentials site.

{% hint style="info" %}
Signing these two requests is **completely safe** and will not access any funds in your wallet.&#x20;

Remember, the first signature allows Disco to access the decentralized identifier you just made, and the second allows Disco to link your wallet to your decentralized ID.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

That's it! Your Data Backpack has been created! :tada::school\_satchel:&#x20;

Next, we'll show you how to claim your first Credential.
