# ðŸŽ’ Create a Data Backpack

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You will need an Ethereum compatible wallet! (We recommend Metamask on Desktop).

For more information on setting up a wallet, please visit [MetaMask Learn](https://learn.metamask.io/).
{% endhint %}

First, head to [https://app.disco.xyz/](https://app.disco.xyz/) on your browser.

Once you connect your wallet, you'll see a request for access to read and store data from [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/).&#x20;

You will be asked to provide a signature from your wallet twice.

The first time will connect you to our Disco website, and the second signature will be to create your "did:identifier" for use on the Disco credentials site.

{% hint style="info" %}
Signing these two requests is **completely safe** and will not access any funds in your wallet.&#x20;

Remember, the first signature allows Disco to access the decentralized identifier you just made, and the second allows Disco to link your wallet to your decentralized ID.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Next, we'll create your Data Backpack.&#x20;
